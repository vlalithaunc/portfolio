        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) covers a range of techniques that appear as sentient behavior by the computer. For example, AI is used to recognize faces in photographs on your social media, beat the World’s Champion in chess, and process your speech when you speak to Siri or Alexa on your phone.</p>
        <p>In this course, we will explore some of the ideas that make AI possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Search:</strong> Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Representing information and drawing inferences from it.</li>
          <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> Dealing with uncertain events using probability.</li>
          <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br \>
        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>Search problems involve an agent that is given an initial state and a goal state, and it returns a solution of how to get from the former to the latter. A navigator app uses a typical search process, where the agent (the thinking part of the program) receives as input your current location and your desired destination, and, based on a search algorithm, returns a suggested path. However, there are many other forms of search problems, like puzzles or mazes.</p>
        
        <h3>15 puzzle</h3>
        <p>Finding a solution to a 15 puzzle would require the use of a search algorithm.</p>
        
        <h3>Agent</h3>
        <p>An entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment. In a navigator app, for example, the agent would be a representation of a car that needs to decide on which actions to take to arrive at the destination.</p>
        
        <h3>State</h3>
        <p>A configuration of an agent in its environment. For example, in a 15 puzzle, a state is any one way that all the numbers are arranged on the board.</p>
        
        <h3>Initial State</h3>
        <p>The state from which the search algorithm starts. In a navigator app, that would be the current location.</p>
        
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <p>Choices that can be made in a state. More precisely, actions can be defined as a function. Upon receiving state s as input, Actions(s) returns as output the set of actions that can be executed in state s. For example, in a 15 puzzle, the actions of a given state are the ways you can slide squares in the current configuration (4 if the empty square is in the middle, 3 if next to a side, 2 if in the corner).</p>
        
        <h3>Transition Model</h3>
        <p>A description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state. More precisely, the transition model can be defined as a function. Upon receiving state s and action a as input, Results(s, a) returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s. For example, given a certain configuration of a 15 puzzle (state s), moving a square in any direction (action a) will bring to a new configuration of the puzzle (the new state).</p>
        
        <h3>State Space</h3>
        <p>The set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions. For example, in a 15 puzzle, the state space consists of all the 16!/2 configurations on the board that can be reached from any initial state. The state space can be visualized as a directed graph with states, represented as nodes, and actions, represented as arrows between nodes.</p>
        
        <h3>Goal Test</h3>
        <p>The condition that determines whether a given state is a goal state. For example, in a navigator app, the goal test would be whether the current location of the agent (the representation of the car) is at the destination. If it is — problem solved. If it’s not — we continue searching.</p>
        
        <h3>Path Cost</h3>
        <p>A numerical cost associated with a given path. For example, a navigator app does not simply bring you to your goal; it does so while minimizing the path cost, finding the fastest way possible for you to get to your goal state.</p>
        
        <br \>
        <h2>Solving Search Problems</h2>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>A sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to the goal state.</p>
        
        <h3>Optimal Solution</h3>
        <p>A solution that has the lowest path cost among all solutions.</p>
        
        <p>In a search process, data is often stored in a node, a data structure that contains the following data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A state</li>
          <li>Its parent node, through which the current node was generated</li>
          <li>The action that was applied to the state of the parent to get to the current node</li>
          <li>The path cost from the initial state to this node</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nodes contain information that makes them very useful for the purposes of search algorithms. They contain a state, which can be checked using the goal test to see if it is the final state. If it is, the node’s path cost can be compared to other nodes’ path costs, which allows choosing the optimal solution. Once the node is chosen, by virtue of storing the parent node and the action that led from the parent to the current node, it is possible to trace back every step of the way from the initial state to this node, and this sequence of actions is the solution.</p>
        
        <p>However, nodes are simply a data structure — they don’t search, they hold information. To actually search, we use the frontier, the mechanism that “manages” the nodes. The frontier starts by containing an initial state and an empty set of explored items, and then repeats the following actions until a solution is reached:</p>
        
        <h3>Repeat:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If the frontier is empty, Stop. There is no solution to the problem.</li>
          <li>Remove a node from the frontier. This is the node that will be considered.</li>
          <li>If the node contains the goal state, return the solution found by tracing back the parent nodes of the goal node.</li>
          <li>Expand the node by generating its children nodes. The new nodes are obtained by performing actions from the current state, generating new states and attaching them to the current node. Add the new nodes to the frontier.</li>
          <li>Add the node to the set of explored nodes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br \>
        <h2>Tree Search</h2>
        <p>Tree Search is a classic approach to search problems, where the frontier contains a set of nodes at a given depth of the search tree. The frontier is represented as a tree with the root node being the initial state and child nodes representing all the possible actions from the current state. The tree expands as nodes are generated, which leads to the exploration of more possible states and solutions.</p>
        
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tree search is easy to implement and understand. The algorithm is straightforward, making it a good starting point for understanding search processes.</li>
          <li>It requires little memory. All it needs is to store one path from the root node down to the leaf node, along with unexpanded sibling nodes for each node on the path.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no guarantee of finding the optimal solution. If the algorithm is “unlucky” and always chooses the wrong path, it could reach the solution state via a highly expensive path, which won’t be the optimal solution.</li>
          <li>It is not complete. If there is an infinite search space or the algorithm gets stuck in loops, it will not necessarily find the solution.</li>
        </ul>
